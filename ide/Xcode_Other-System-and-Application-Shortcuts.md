#Other System and Application Shortcuts
Table 3-1 lists system-reserved and commonly used keyboard shortcuts.

Before you change keyboard shortcuts or implement them in your application, use this section to find:

+ Key sequences reserved for use by OS X, indicated by an  icon.
Users rely on these shortcuts to perform the specified actions regardless of which application is currently running (these include shortcuts reserved for accessibility purposes). Do not override these shortcuts.

+ Key sequences recommended for common application tasks.
Users expect these shortcuts to be consistent from application to application. If your application performs these tasks, you should provide the same shortcuts for those tasks.

If your application does not perform the task associated with a recommended shortcut, think very carefully before you consider overriding it. Your users are likely to know and expect the original, established meaning.

> Note: Be aware that Apple may reserve other keyboard shortcuts in the future.

For guidance on creating new keyboard shortcuts, see macOS Human Interface Guidelines.
